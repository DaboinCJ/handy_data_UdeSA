Daniel is uncertain how to deal with Sam and his problems without his wife present, especially in light of a potential budding romance within their household.

Harry (Alan Rickman) and Karen (Dame Emma Thompson) have been in a stable long term marriage. His new assistant Mia (Heike Makatsch) drops hints to him that she would like them to be romantically involved.

He's also not sure if he's ready to marry his long time girlfriend, lawyer Tracy Stover.

Some reason is what Willie may need in trying to figure out why he is attracted to Marty, his father's thirteen year old neighbor, especially as Willie learns that Tracy has decided to join him for the reunion.",1
