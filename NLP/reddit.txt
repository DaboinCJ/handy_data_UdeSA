ANSWER: Argentina has always had inflation problems, even before COVID. The main problem is that voters themselves are financial illiterates. What the country needs is fiscal discipline. The populace doesn't want to hear it. They've voted out every politician that tried to enact some sort of fiscal discipline to rein in the inflation. Then replaced those with politicians that will give them what they want: welfare and uncontrolled spending. You can go around the country and ask people what they think the country needs: majority will tell you they want more welfare. Very few will answer the country needs to tighten its belt, reduce spending and increase taxes. It's not hard to see why the country is experiencing crazy levels of inflation. It has very low productive capacity relative to its spending, so the only way it can fund its irresponsible spending is by printing more money. Well, that only leads to more inflation. But they can't help it because the populace doesn't want to stop welfare spending. Frankly, the country is hopeless. The people need to be taught financial literacy for that country to get out of the mess it is in.
