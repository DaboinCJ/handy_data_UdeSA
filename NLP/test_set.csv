El secreto de sus ojos,"In 1999, retired Argentinian federal justice agent Benjamín Espósito is writing a novel, using an old closed case as the source material. That case is the brutal rape and murder of Liliana Coloto. In addition to seeing the extreme grief of the victim's husband Ricardo Morales, Benjamín, his assistant Pablo Sandoval, and newly hired department chief Irene Menéndez-Hastings were personally affected by the case as Benjamín and Pablo tracked the killer, hence the reason why the unsatisfactory ending to the case has always bothered him. Despite the department already having two other suspects, Benjamín and Pablo ultimately were certain that a man named Isidoro Gómez is the real killer. Although he is aware that historical accuracy is not paramount for the novel, the process of revisiting the case is more an issue of closure for him. He tries to speak to the key players in the case, most specifically Irene, who still works in the justice department and who he has always been attracted to but never pursued due to the differences in their ages and social classes. The other issue is that Gómez is still at large, no one aware if he is alive or dead. But as Pablo at the time mentioned that passion is one thing that cannot be changed in behavior, Benjamín learns now that that premise still holds true.",

Nadie nos mira,"NADIE NOS MIRA is a film about the struggle of self-imposed exile; how the pleasures of anonymity and freedom contrast with the pain of loneliness and loss that shapes immigrant experience. NICO, mid 30's, is a young Argentine actor fighting to build a career in the US, without assistance, or connections, never too far from heart-breaking failure, but often blinded by the mirage of immediate success. Nico has left a promising acting career in Argentina, after a tumultuous break-up with his mentor/producer. He lands in New York, lured into believing that his talent will help him find success ""on his own"" and prove his self-worth. But that's not what he finds. Too blond to play latino, his accent to strong to play anything else, Nico gets stuck between identities: that of the successful South American actor, and temporary immigrant needing to juggle odd jobs and under-the-table employment, in search of the ever-elusive acting part that will provide an adjustment of status. When Andrea, his beautiful Argentinean ex-roommate and confidante, asks him to take care of her baby Theo; Nico becomes his male nanny (""manny"") and doesn't suspect how deeply this new bond will affect him. NOBODY'S WATCHING examines an immigrant experience that doesn't often land on the screen; the bittersweet struggle of choosing to make a new land your own, and the realization that actual success lies in the journey of self- discovery and the unexpected gains that ""failure"" can provide.",

The sixth speaks of captive women in the 19th century. My all forms ""La Flor"". These six episodes, these six genres have one thing in common: their four actresses.

La mirada invisible,"Buenos Aires, March 1982. On the streets of the Argentinean capital, people are challenging the military dictatorship. The walls of the school are thick and redoubtable. A secure promise of the guaranteed preservation of the good old days of school routine from anything that may happen outside its walls in the neighbouring streets, in Buenos Aires itself, in the Argentina of 1982. María Teresa is a classroom assistant at that school, an innocent - or maybe just ignorant - mistress of ceremonies, a bystander. She is twenty years old. She started work when it was still summer and Mr. Biasutto, the chief classroom assistant, made quite clear to her at her first interview the sort of attitude she is expected to adopt with students because it would not be an easy task to arrive at what he called 'the optimum surveillance point': Always on the 'qui vive', never missing a thing, but never giving cause for alarm amongst the students. A surveillance which would pick up on everything but would never be picked up on itself. A fleeting look on the face of the pervert, or the warden, or maybe the master. But if everything is out of order -even for her-, everything is transgression. And when María Teresa, hot on the trail of the merest, possibly imaginary wisp of tobacco smoke, starts hiding in the boys lavatories to catch smokers in flagrante delicto and haul them up before the authorities, slowly morphing the whole procedure into a clandestine habit of dubious piquancy; not exactly breaking the rules but bending them willy nilly, twisting, diverting them come what may but, of course, with utter correctness and obeisance to a surveillance emanating from the inflexible custodianship of a complete and atrocious normality. Surveillance, custodianship that could possibly be enforced beyond the boundaries of this enclosed world, because beyond the sheer masonry encasing this school, where the future ruling classes have studied and are studying, there is another world, there is an entire country that has virtually nothing to do with it.",

Dr. Bernard's lonely home life which entails caring for his invalid wife colors the way he approaches the investigation. Two is the killer himself, milquetoast Teodoro Ulber, a private English teacher whose feelings of inadequacies as a man are a result of being ridiculed his entire life by women. And three is Amalia Keitel, a singer working under the stage name Rita at a seedy nightclub which is frequented by Ulber as a ""friend"" of Amalia's colleague Cora, and which is already on the authorities' radar as being a drug den. Through the window just outside her dressing room, Amalia caught a brief glimpse of the killer dumping the body of the first victim, Amalia initially reluctant to report what she saw, despite it affecting her emotionally, in the primary goal of protecting her own adolescent daughter from publicly being connected to someone like ""Rita"".",

Milagros also loves dancing and very often runs away from the convent to enjoy the popular balls in town together with one of her mates. Dancing is like paradise to her; she dances and laughs, laughs and dances. That's how she meets Ivo, a young man who will find it difficult to associate that cheerful and beautiful young woman with Cholo, the girl who disguised as a boy can sell cold sodas in the soccer fields and stamps in the streets. Ivo and his father have a construction company. One Saturday morning, he and his friend Bobby head to a nearby soccer field to watch a game.
